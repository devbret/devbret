### Hello, World!

I am a Full Stack Web Developer, who loves learning; especially when solving challenges as part of making unique applications for internet users throughout the global web. I began my journey in technology with WordPress, web analytics, digital advertising, community management and streaming media. More recently I’ve been working with Python, TypeScript, React, JavaScript, MySQL, Git and RESTful APIs among other technologies. Eventually I’d like to work as a Senior Artificial Intelligence Engineer.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.
