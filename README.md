### Hello, World!

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer committed to learning about and building tools for making the internet more interesting and secure. I started my journey in technology via WordPress and digital communications, working with analytics, media and community-driven platforms. More recently I have been developing OSINT tools, dashboards for cybersecurity insights and scalable data applications using Python, React, TypeScript and SQL. I am particularly excited about the intersection of intelligence, automation and user experience. As a result I have set out to become a Senior Artificial Intelligence Engineer.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile.
